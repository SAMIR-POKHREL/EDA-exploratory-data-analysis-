# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Hands-on practice of machine learning concepts using Python and real datasets.

## Topics Covered till now:
- Regression: Linear & Logistic Regression
- Classification: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression
- Data Preprocessing: Encoding, Scaling, Missing Value Handling
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn


##Note:
This repository is continuously updated as I learn new ML concepts and apply them to practice datasets.
