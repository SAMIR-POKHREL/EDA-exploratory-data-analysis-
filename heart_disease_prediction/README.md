Heart Disease Prediction App ❤️🩺

A machine learning project that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user-provided health parameters. Built using Python, trained models, and deployed as a Streamlit web app for easy interaction.

##Features

Implements and compares multiple classification models:

1.Naive Bayes

2.Decision Tree

3.Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels

4.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

5.Logistic Regression

6.Evaluates models and selects the best-performing model (KNN).

7.Saves the trained model and scaler in pickle format.

8.Provides a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions.

9.Accepts user inputs for parameters like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., and predicts heart disease risk.
