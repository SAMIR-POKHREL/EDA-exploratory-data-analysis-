📉 Regression-model
FIrst Linear Regression model using sklearn and other python libraries to predict car prices.

In this small project i learned what different encoding methods like(Label Encoding vs One-Hot Encoding) can have huge difference on model accuracy.

Achieved 83% R² with One-Hot Encoding and 73% with Label Encoding, which shows the importance of proper feature encoding while working with dataset.
